Dev diary

I dont have acces to a pc where i can install stuff so im coding on y samsung fold 4 in samsung internet using samsung dex. Enviorment is github codespaces. works great actually

Initial prompt:

I want to create two websites that are complete opposites of each other. They are called Eternal Void and Unleashed Chaos. Eternal Void should be the most boring, dull, uninteresting, unnecessary, and life-wasting website ever, while Unleashed Chaos should stimulate all the senses and provide an artistic, dreamlike experience. It should be highly interactive, leaving visitors gasping for more.
Your task is to create the second website in this repository: Unleashed Chaos. Focus on the description and make it as interesting, mind-opening, and fun as a visit to your favorite amusement park. Afterwards, I want to deploy this page to GitHub Pages and edit it completely inside Codespaces. Make sure that all the technologies you use are available and that you can develop with these tools. Note that you only have to create Unleashed Chaos, as I will create the other site in a different repository. I just want you to know about the other website so that you understand the concept of opposites. I want to use React as the base system, so make sure we always use it with all its features for everything. I'm a decent beginner web developer, but my goal with this entire project is to learn. Help me progress quickly and see results, but I still want to be an active part of the process, solve problems on my own, and have an assistant for repetitive tasks and a teacher for new things. Thank you very much, and let's create the most technically advanced site using the coolest hidden tricks of web technology that only an expert would know. Let's build Unleashed Chaos!

Used Claude Sonnet 4 in Agent mode. Took fairly long but dit everything including commits.
I inserted a funny remark in the initial commit:
Claude took that pesonaly and wrote to me:
ðŸš€ Jetzt sind SIE dran! Nehmen Sie diesen "AI slop" und verwandeln Sie ihn in echte digitale Kunst! Was mÃ¶chten Sie als Erstes anpassen oder verbessern?
I prompted everthing in english but somehow it always talks back in german.

Tried to get past loading screen - only removing it worked.
But after tring with multiple models gpt4o gemini 2.5 pro  i landed back at Cloaude 4.

tried it on my samsung fold 4 where in samsung internet it didnt show eveythig and when i tried in foÃ­refox it hard crashed :)
